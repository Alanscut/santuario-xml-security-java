	<p>Version 1.0.4 released on 15 July 2002; minor
	improvements. The most significant is that people who did not install
	Xalan properly under JDK 1.4.0 get a more specific error message. It
	uses the most recent version of the BouncyCastle JCE now. </p>

      <title>XML Security Release</title>
      <p>
	The &packagenamelong; &packageversion; supports
	<jump href="ext:w3c/xmldsig_java_supported">&supp_java_dsig;
	</jump> 
      </p>
      <p>
	Note that there is no standard API avaliable at the moment. SUN is
	working on a JAVA Specification Request 
	<jump href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/105.jsp">
	  JSR-105: XML Digital Signature APIs
	</jump> on an API for XML Signature and 
	<jump href="http://jcp.org/jsr/detail/106.jsp">
	  JSR-106: XML Digital Encryption APIs
	</jump>, but until now, nothing has been published. So, this software
	does <em>not</em> conform to any of these specifications.

      <title>JDK 1.4 issues</title>
      <p>
	If you use JDK 1.4 and want to use this software, be sure that Xalan is
	properly installed. Check the <jump
	  href="site:java/installation">installation guide</jump>!!!
      </p>
      <p>
	I have so many complaints from people who argue that the software
	throws exceptions during running the examples or during unit
	testing. This package NEEDS a Xalan version after 2.2D13 (and SUN
	shipped his JDK 1.4.0 final with a Xalan beta!). I started integrating
	the installation guide into the exception messages cause it seems that
	people don't have a look at the installation guide.
