      <p>
	Part of this software can be used to create and verify arbitrary forms
	of XML Signatures. The documentation available here is not very huge;
	my first approach is to supply usage examples which are available in
	the <code>src_samples/</code> directory to give interested users a
	first starting point to jump-start with XML Signature. 
      </p>
      <note>
	The samples divide into two groups: Samples that <em>create</em> and
	samples that <em>verify</em> Signatures. Eventually, you should adjust
	the verifying program to another filename if you get
	<code>FileNotFoundException</code>s.
