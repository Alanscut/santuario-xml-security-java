	  <title>Provided Tools</title>
	  <p>
		A number of very simple "tools" (really examples) are provided with
		the XML Security library.  These can be used either to provide examples
		of how to use the library or as simple utilities in their own right for
		performing canonicalisation and signature functions.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The tools are :
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li><em>c14n</em> - A tool to output a Canonicalised version of an 
		  input document.</li>
		<li><em>checksig</em> - A tool to validate a signature in an XML
		  input document</li>
		<li><em>templatesign</em> - A tool to sign an XML document that already
		  has the &lt;Signature&gt; structure installed, but needs the references
		  hashed and the SignatureValue set.</li>
		<li><em>txfmout</em> - A tool to take an XML Signature and output
		  the fully transformed references to stdout or a nominated file</li>
		<li><em>threadTest</em> - A Windows only program that runs up a number
		  of threads which simultaneously sign and validate documents.  A
		  number of documents are modified in between (to cause the signature
		  validation to fail).</li>
		<li><em>siginf</em> - A tool to read in an XML Signature and dump
		  various details about the signature and references to the terminal
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
		The tools can all be run with no command line arguments to see their
		parameters.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		One extra "tool" is provided - <em>xtest</em>.  This is really a testing
		program that exercises various capabilities of the library and compares
		the results with known good results.
